# classifying_time_signature_in-music



## About

 
--With the advent of neural nets, the idea that a computer has the ability to find patterns within data hasn't been proven more. Through the --use of many convulutional layers, deep learning unlocks puzzles which are too complex for us humans.

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to find temporal patterns in music which give it its structure in time, namely, the time signature. --We are all familiar with the natural impulse of tapping along while vibing to a good song, --

“The aim of a beat tracker is to recover a sequence of time instants from a musical input that are consistent with the times when a human might tap their foot. Beyond an exercise in modelling a human response to a musical stimulus, beat tracking can be used in many applications including musical interaction systems, content-based audio effects, and increasingly as a meaningful temporal segmentation for higher level MIR tasks such as chord extraction, structural segmentation of audio  and music similarity.” 




### Goal etc..



### Some fundamental terminology

Fourier transform
A few buckets of paint were spilled together and we have a unique blend of colors the fourier transform can be though of the formula which 
extracts the components of which this unique blend is comrprised of.

--Mel is a transformation to have the data similar to how humans hear it.

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient
"Because the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into components that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number of applications in digital signal processing, e.g., for filtering, and in this context the discretized input to the transform is customarily referred to as a signal, which exists in the time domain. The output is called a spectrum or transform and exists in the frequency domain."
